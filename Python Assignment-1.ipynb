    "The conventions commonly followed when declaring variables in Python:\n",
    "1. Descriptive Names\n",
    "2. Snake Case(e.g.my_variable_name)\n",
    "3. Start with a Letter or Underscore\n",
    "4. Avoid Reserved Keywords:For example, if, else, while, for, class, def, etc.\n",
    "5. Be Explicit: Choose descriptive names instead of short or cryptic names. Code readability is essential in Python.\n",
    "6. Consistency: Be consistent with variable naming conventions throughout your codebase.\n",
    "7. Avoid Single-Character Names: Unless used as loop counters or in very specific contexts, avoid single-character variable names.\n",
    "8. Use Nouns: Variables should typically represent objects or values, so use nouns for their names.\n",
    "9. Use Constants in UPPERCASE: If you want to define constants, use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., PI, MAX_LENGTH).\n",
    "10. Avoid Prefixing with Type: Unlike some languages, you generally don't need to prefix variable names with their data type in Python (e.g., int_count)."
